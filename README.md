# 🧠 Bayesian Statistics for Data Science

This two-day intensive workshop introduces participants to the fundamentals of Bayesian statistics applied to real-world data science problems, with a special focus on the tourism sector. Through a combination of theoretical sessions and hands-on labs using PyMC and Python, students will learn how to build probabilistic models that account for uncertainty, improve interpretability, and enhance predictive accuracy.

## ✈️ Application Context: Tourism Analytics

All examples and datasets will be drawn from the tourism industry. Topics include:

- Modeling visitor behavior
- Forecasting hotel occupancy
- Analyzing satisfaction surveys
- Segmenting destinations based on reviews and characteristics
- Making probabilistic inferences under uncertainty
